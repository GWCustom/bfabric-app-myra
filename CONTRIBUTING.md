# Contributing to Our Project

First off, thank you for considering contributing to our project. We love to collaborate and value your contributions to our codebase.

## How to Contribute

Here are some guidelines we'd like you to follow:

### 0. Consider Reaching Out

It's possible that the changes you wish to make, are already in our backlog! Please write us or create an issue (if you'd like), before forking, as we may already be building the feature you want! 

### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This creates your own copy of the project where you can make changes.

### 2. Create a Branch

From your fork, create a new branch to work on. It's a good practice to name your branch something related to the changes you're going to make.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

With your new branch checked out, make your changes to the code. Be sure to commit your changes locally.

### 4. Submit a Pull Request

After you've committed your changes, push your branch to your fork on GitHub. Then, navigate to the original repository, and you should see a prompt to submit a pull request from your branch.

### 5. Code Review

Wait for a maintainer to review your pull request. Be open to feedback and willing to make additional changes if requested.
